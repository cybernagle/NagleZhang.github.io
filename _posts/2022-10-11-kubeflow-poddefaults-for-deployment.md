## issue
kubeflow version v1.3.1-rc
Kubeflow is not able apply poddefaults to pod which generated by deployments. but , pod, statefulset are ok.

## reason
Once  k8s create pod from deployment, statefulset or daemonset, it will generate a applyconfiguration  
kubeflow using adminssion webhoook to capture this applyconfiguration, then post it to webhook controller.  
afterwards , kubeflow adminssion webhook controller will read the data from it's request, which include pod namespace, pod name.  
this issue is because statefulset & pod applyconfiguration do have field namespace. but deployment's applyconfiguration do not have such data.
